# Mini Node API

This is a minimal RESTful API for managing users, built with Node.js and SQLite.  
Itâ€™s a small project to demonstrate backend fundamentals like routing, database integration, and request handling.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Uses **SQLite** for lightweight, file-based storage  
- âœ… Synchronous queries via `better-sqlite3` for simplicity  
- âœ… **Express.js** server with clean route structure  
- âœ… **Morgan** logger for request/response headers and DB queries  
- âœ… JWT based authentication with access and refresh tokens for secure session monitoring

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why this project?

This mini-project was built to:

- Practice building REST APIs from scratch  
- Explore the request/response cycle, middleware, and routing  
- Understand authentication and basic security concepts  
- Gain hands-on experience with logging and SQLite

## ðŸ›  What's next?

- [ ] Add user roles and permissions  
- [ ] Expand API endpoints (e.g., update, search)  
- [ ] Add unit tests and test DB support
