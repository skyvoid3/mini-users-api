# Mini Node API + React Frontend

This is a minimal full-stack web application consisting of a RESTful API for managing users built with Node.js and SQLite, **plus** a React frontend for user interaction.  
Itâ€™s a small project to demonstrate backend fundamentals like routing, database integration, and request handling, as well as frontend UI and client-server communication.
